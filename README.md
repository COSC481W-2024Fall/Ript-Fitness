Ript Fitness is a fitness application that will help people track their workouts, as well as other features related to fitness and getting healthy. It uses Java Spring Boot as the backend to create HTTP endpoints that the frontend will call in order to get relevant data and display it to the user. Its specific features are still being discussed, but at the least it will help people track their workouts and get healthier. It is a full stack application that is centered around fitness and health.
